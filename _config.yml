  Welcome to StagVision, objectively the best site for computer vision related projects (that's true!). My main focus is to showcase the cool
  projects I do in my spare time and try and offer educational material for anyone interested. For any suggestions or for corrections to my gross
  errors, don't be afraid to contact me through e-mail.
